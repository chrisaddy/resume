{rrr}
{R \textbullet{} regression \textbullet{} PCA}
{
R library for reduced-rank regression with applications to principle component analysis, linear discriminant analysis and canonical variate analysis. While I don't maintain the library as much as I would like, it has been downloaded over 16,000 times and is used by researchers in the US, Japan, and Australia in a number of fields including oncology, nutrition, and geriatrics.
