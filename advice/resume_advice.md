## Advice from Alexander Titus (VP of AI/ML @ Avidity)

> I'm up to my eyeballs right now reviewing hundreds of applications for the roles I'm hiring for, and here is my real-time feedback for job seekers:

1. **Too many words. Way too many. We don't need an essay. We need facts.**

2. **Don't "throw a Hail Mary" and apply for things you're not qualified for.** No, not just missing a bullet point or two, but completely unqualified. Hiring managers remember that.

3. **Don't lie.** I just reviewed an application from someone who listed a PhD from Harvard under their education but qualified it as "Application submitted and received a positive response from an advisor." That's not a PhD from Harvard.

4. **Tech keywords.** If you list every piece of tech under the sun, I don't believe you know how to use any of them. In a world where ChatGPT can write a lot of the code we need, lying about being an expert in everything doesn't work.

5. **Tell me what you have built and delivered.**

> TL;DR â€“ I wish everyone the best in their job hunts, but there are ways you can help your chances by not making a bad impression. Be honest, be good at what you do, and show us both.
