# Job Search Preferences

## Current Situation
- **Current role:** Engineering Manager, AI/ML at MNTN (June 2025 - Present)
- **Setup:** Fully remote, player-coach with team of 3, hands-on coding
- **Recent work:** Shipped 2 AI/ML products (deliverability forecasting, media plan budget allocation with LLM explanations), built Vertex AI tooling

## Location
- **Strong preference:** Remote
- **Open to:** Hybrid in Philadelphia
- **Maybe:** NYC if 1-2 days/week max

## Company Stage
- Startup or growth stage
- No big enterprise / corporate bureaucracy

## Role Type
- **Prefer:** IC or player-coach (writing code + some leadership)
- **Would consider management if:** CTO, Chief AI/ML Officer, Founding Engineer — but must still be writing code
- **Pass on:** Pure people management, pure research

## Domain & Focus
- **Most excited about:** AI Engineering, developer tools, infra
- **Also good:** ML Platform, Applied ML
- **Ideal customers:** Other engineers / developers
- **Dream companies (vibes):** Railway, Vercel, Modal, Replicate, Weights & Biases, Hugging Face, LangChain, Anthropic, OpenAI (devrel/infra), Prefect, Dagster, dbt Labs

## Compensation
- $250k+ total comp

## Dealbreakers
- Enterprise red tape / slow shipping culture
- ML as cost center (not the product)
- "AI company" that just wrapped ChatGPT
- Pure management (no code)
- Heavy on-site requirements without strong justification
- Solo ML person with no platform/team-building path
- Boring B2B enterprise SaaS where you'd never meet users
- Heavily regulated environments that slow shipping (healthcare, fintech compliance-heavy)

## What Gets Me Excited
- Ship fast, iterate with real users
- Building tools for engineers
- Open source or dev-facing products
- Rust + Python stack valued
- Small team, high ownership
- No BS culture

## Application Strategy

### Tiered Approach
1. **Easy Apply / Low effort roles** — Use default resume, just apply, log in `jobs_to_review.md`
2. **Good fit / High effort roles** — Full workflow:
   - Create `applications/{company}_{role}/` directory
   - Tailor resume (keywords, tone — not fabricating)
   - Write cover letter
   - Create notes.md with company research, fit analysis, interview prep
   - Compile both to PDF

### Signals to Go Full Effort
- Developer tools / infra company
- Remote-first
- Startup or growth stage
- Customers are engineers
- Tech stack includes Rust, Python, ML platforms
- Role involves building products, not just maintaining

## Notes
_Updated as we learn more through job conversations_

- 2025-01-30: Healthcare AI roles (like Nxt Level posting) are a soft pass — regulated environment conflicts with "ship fast" preference, customers aren't engineers. Will easy-apply if low effort but won't invest heavily.
- 2025-01-30: On-site 5 days/week is a hard pass, even in Philly.
- 2025-01-30: Recruiter posts with unnamed companies are fine for easy apply, but lower priority for full effort.
- 2025-01-30: "Vibe coding" mentioned unironically in JDs is a red flag.
- 2025-01-30: Seniority mismatches (15+ years when I have ~7) are usually skips unless comp is exceptional.
- 2025-01-30: "Matrix organization" mentions are red flags for enterprise bureaucracy.
- 2025-01-30: Willing to apply to imperfect fits for interview practice, especially if Easy Apply.
- 2025-01-30: Some companies auto-reject if you apply to multiple roles — track companies applied to.
