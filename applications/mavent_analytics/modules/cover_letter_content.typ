  [Throughout my career, I have balanced hands-on ML implementation with strategic technical leadership. At PepsiCo, I architected AWS-based ML infrastructure that reduced model deployment time by 75%, while also founding a Generative AI Lab that successfully implemented LLM and RAG applications with vector databases. My experience spans the full ML lifecycleâ€”from building containerized deployment pipelines and CI/CD systems to implementing infrastructure as code and optimizing cloud resources for ML workloads. I have consistently delivered measurable business impact through ML while mentoring engineers and establishing MLOps best practices across organizations.]
