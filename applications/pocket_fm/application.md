## Job Description
About Pocket FM 

Pocket FM is on a mission to deliver personalized and immersive audio experiences to listeners worldwide. We are revolutionizing the audio entertainment industry through long-form storytelling, supported by our cutting-edge platform that serves millions of listeners and generates billions of minutes of engagement monthly. We leverage Generative AI in producing content and streamlining operations, developing innovative solutions for cutting-edge challenges in the AI landscape across all modalitiesâ€”text, audio, and images. With strong backing and rapid user base growth, Pocket FM is an exciting and dynamic place to join.

About the Role

We are seeking an experienced research scientist to drive innovation in long-form content generation and localization. Your work will focus on creating seamless, culturally-tailored storytelling experiences, evaluating content quality through user engagement metrics, and transforming research breakthroughs into tangible solutions. You will leverage novel agentic approaches for large-scale language applications and redesign how language models interact with external data sources like knowledge graphs. Additionally, you will iterate on state-of-the-art fine-tuning techniques, such as RLHF, to train our production models for cultural and linguistic accuracy. By working with Machine Translation (MT) and Large Language Model (LLM) technology, you will enhance Pocket FM's global reach, enabling millions of listeners worldwide to enjoy stories in their native language. This role offers the opportunity to contribute to cutting-edge research while also having a direct and measurable impact on the company's success.

The senior research scientist will have the opportunity to mentor and guide the work of junior research scientists and work collaboratively with engineers to build and iterate on R&D experiments and drive them to production.

The team is open for the candidate to be located anywhere in North America with the requirement to travel occasionally to meet the team in person a few times a year.

Key Responsibilities

- Implement new algorithms, run experiments, design evaluations, and improve content creation, adaptation, and translation globally across many languages
- Implement and optimize finetuning pipelines with techniques like RLHF, DPO, and LoRA to efficiently train production-scale language models
- Develop novel finetuning techniques to improve language model behavior and alignment with listener expectations
- Develop scalable distributed information retrieval systems, such as search engines, knowledge graphs, indexing, ranking, and query understanding
- Ensure the quality and consistency of AI-generated content through rigorous testing and evaluation
- Support the team in publishing research findings in top-tier AI conferences and journals

Qualifications

- Master's or PhD degree in Computer Science, Machine Learning, or a related field
- Significant Python and applied research experience in industrial settings
- Proficiency in frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow
- Demonstrated experience in deep learning, especially language modeling with transformers and machine translation
- Extensive experience with methods of training and fine-tuning large language models, including reinforcement learning, policy optimization, and supervised fine-tuning
- Hands-on experience with advanced LLM tooling, building LLM-powered agents, and retrieval-augmented generation
- Experience building and iterating on knowledge extraction and graph-based representation of information
- Prior experience working with vector databases, search indices, or other data stores for search and retrieval use cases
- Preference for fast-paced, collaborative projects with concrete goals, quantitatively tested through A/B experiments
- Published research in peer-reviewed journals and conferences on relevant topics
