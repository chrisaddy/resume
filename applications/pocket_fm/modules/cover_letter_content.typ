  [Throughout my career, I have focused on developing and fine-tuning large language models for real-world applications. At PepsiCo, I founded and led the Generative AI Lab, implementing advanced fine-tuning techniques such as RLHF and LoRA to improve content generation quality. I have extensive experience with transformer architectures, information retrieval systems, and knowledge graphs that enable contextually rich content creation. My work has consistently delivered measurable business impact through the application of machine learning, including an 8% revenue growth through transformer-based recommendation models and a 60% reduction in model fine-tuning time through optimized infrastructure.]
