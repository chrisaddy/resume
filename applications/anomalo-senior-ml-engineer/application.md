## Job Description
We're looking for a Machine Learning Engineer to help build, deploy and support Anomalo's suite of Generative AI products that process unstructured data and support enterprise customers. This role is part of a new 0-1 product team, where you'll shape product quality and integrate multiple LLMs into real-world applications.

What You'll Do:
- Develop and deploy GenAI-driven products, including customer-facing applications and internal tools for engineering teams.
- Work with unstructured data and define product quality standards for a rapidly evolving space.
- Collaborate with design partners and enterprise customers to understand how ML and LLMs can be applied effectively.
- Build and refine retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models and fine-tune LLMs for specific use cases.
- Own projects from concept to production, ensuring scalability and performance in real-world environments.

What We're Looking For:
- Strong Python expertise (ML engineering, data processing, and API development).
- Experience deploying GenAI/LLM-based applications (e.g., chatbots, recommendation systems).
- Familiarity with OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, and similar GenAI platforms.
- Background in production-scale ML applications, particularly LLMs for enterprise use cases.
- Self-starter mentality—comfortable with ambiguity and taking initiative in a fast-moving environment.

Nice to Have:
- Experience with RAG, fine-tuning LLMs, or scaling GenAI models.
- Background in data-driven product development or ML for incident response/support systems.

Salary Range: $210,000 - $265,000 plus meaningful equity

Note: Only candidates who reside and are authorized to work in the continental United States will be considered.
