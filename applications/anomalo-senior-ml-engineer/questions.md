## ML Experience Questions

1. **Please briefly summarize your experience production-scale ML applications, particularly LLMs for enterprise use cases.**

   At Pepsico, I founded the Generative AI Lab, leading a team that built production-scale LLM applications using OpenAI models for eCommerce. We implemented RAG-based systems and developed standardized Python APIs for enterprise-wide LLM integration. At URBN, I created LLM-backed product extraction capabilities while implementing quality monitoring for unstructured data pipelines. My experience spans the full ML lifecycle – from infrastructure optimization to deployment at scale – with particular focus on systems that maintain enterprise reliability while processing both structured and unstructured data. My background in anomaly detection and unsupervised learning for data quality aligns directly with Anomalo's core business.
