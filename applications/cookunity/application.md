- Strong problem-solving skills and a clear understanding of algorithmic design.
- Ability to communicate effectively with both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Nice To Have:
- Experience in the food technology sector is a plus.
- Experience working with Generative AI and its applications in personalization or search.
- Contributions to research or publications in areas such as graph-based modeling, recommendation systems, customer retention (e.g., churn prediction), or lifetime value estimation.
- Experience with Graph AI algorithms and network discovery techniques, including analyzing complex relationships and patterns within data networks.

Where You'll Be:
- We offer you the flexibility to work where you work best!
- This team operates within the Eastern Standard time zone for collaboration.
