- Evaluate and leverage AI capabilities embedded within existing third-party tools and platforms.
- Manage and mentor a high-performing team of engineers, data scientists, and architects to deliver scalable, production-grade solutions.
- Build and maintain a library of reusable solution patterns and frameworks for future innovation initiatives.
- Communicate emerging tech concepts, trends, and ROI to executive leadership in a compelling and strategic manner.
- Provide regular updates to executive stakeholders and board-level audiences regarding innovation progress, use cases, and outcomes.
- Represent the organization at conferences and industry events to stay current and build partnerships within the innovation ecosystem.
- Partner with affiliated entities to co-develop or align with existing data science, cloud, and automation tools.

### Qualifications

- Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Data Science, Engineering, or a related field (Master's or Ph.D. preferred).
- 5+ years of experience in AI/ML, advanced analytics, or data science leadership roles — ideally in a financial, fintech, or capital markets environment.
- Strong foundation in machine learning algorithms, statistical modeling, and data strategy.
- Experience leading cross-functional technology and data teams from strategy to implementation.
- Deep understanding of cloud infrastructure and modern data platforms.
- Familiarity with blockchain, tokenization, or distributed ledger technologies is a plus.
