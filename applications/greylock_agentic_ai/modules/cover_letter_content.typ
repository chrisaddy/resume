#let opening_paragraph(position, company_name) = {
  [I am writing to express my interest in the Sr. Machine Learning Engineer (Agentic AI) position at your healthcare-focused portfolio company. With over 7 years of experience building and leading machine learning teams, including founding a Generative AI Lab that implemented Large Language Model (LLM) solutions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the intersection of Generative AI and healthcare at a late-stage startup.]
}

#let body_paragraph = {
  [Throughout my career, I have specialized in developing production-ready machine learning systems with a focus on deep learning and natural language processing. At Pepsico, I built agentic AI solutions that autonomously personalized customer experiences and led a team of engineers implementing LLM applications across digital platforms. My experience spans the full ML lifecycle - from designing robust infrastructure for model training and deployment to creating feature stores and experimentation frameworks that accelerate development. I've consistently served in staff-level leadership roles, translating complex ML concepts for stakeholders while guiding cross-functional adoption of AI capabilities.]
}

#let company_specific_paragraph(company_name) = {
  [I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to build a brand-new machine learning team focused on applying Generative AI to healthcare challenges. Having previously established ML functions from the ground up at both large companies and startups, I understand the unique challenges of creating scalable, production-ready AI systems while fostering a culture of innovation. Though the healthcare domain would be relatively new to me, I'm excited to leverage my experience with LLMs and deep learning to tackle meaningful problems in this space. I believe my combination of startup experience, technical depth in Generative AI, and staff-level leadership would make me an effective founding member of your machine learning team.]
