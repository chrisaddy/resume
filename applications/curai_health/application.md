## Job Description
Curai Health is an AI-powered virtual clinic on a mission to improve access to care at scale. As the pioneer in deploying machine learning into clinical workflows, Curai Health enables its dedicated, specially trained clinicians to deliver primary care to more people at a fraction of the cost. Easy-to-use and convenient, Curai Health partners with insurers and health systems to keep patients engaged in their care over time, improving health outcomes and reducing costs.

Our company is remote-first and we consider candidates across the United States. Our corporate office is located in San Francisco.

Machine Learning Engineering at Curai

We are looking for a Senior ML Engineer to join our AI team. Our team is responsible for Curai's ML/automation technology. Your work will have a tremendous direct impact on provider and patient-facing ML-augmented applications, thereby providing low-friction, high-quality care to patients of Curai Health.

We are primarily a text-based service and NLP is at the core of our ML work. With recent advances in large language models, we see a tremendous acceleration in capabilities. A non-trivial part of our work involves appropriately leveraging and building on top of these models thoughtfully (and with scaffolding) to our use cases and backing them up with a sound automated evaluation. In addition, we use the in-house deidentified data as robust feedback data for continuously improving the ML models.

Who You Are 

- A self-starter and have a growth mindset
- Enjoy tackling complex problems in a scientific and data-driven way
- Thrive in ambiguity and love tackling complex problems that span multiple systems
- Enjoy thinking through trade-offs with mindfulness of near-term needs and Curai's long-term strategy
- Are collaborative and appreciate working with people with diverse expertise

What You'll Do

- You will develop and improve our AI systems used in our patient and physician-facing product features in collaboration with our product, clinical, engineering, and design teams. Includes fine-tuning large language models, developing model evaluations, and dealing with hard engineering constraints like latency and expensive model inference
- Design offline and online evaluations to test ML product features, and perform data-driven analysis of the results to find actionable insights
- Enable rapid and rigorous scientific innovation by a multidisciplinary team of Curai clinicians, engineers, and researchers, through platform, tools, and documentation
- Mentor interns and junior team members
- Interview diverse talent to build and grow a strong ML team

What You'll Need

- 5+ years of industry experience in ML/NLP, including building production systems
- "End-to-end" experience building ML production systems: Along with strong ML fundamentals, you will need expertise in the entire lifecycle of machine learning production systems, such as data processing, modeling, deployment, monitoring, maintenance, and improving the models over time using feedback loops
- "Product sense" or intuition on what to build: You will need to be able to translate product intuition into data-driven hypotheses that result in impactful machine learning/engineering solutions
- Strong communication skills: This role involves collaboration with product, engineering, clinical, and research teams. Understanding the audience's mental models and communicating ideas crisply to diverse stakeholders will be vital to the role. You should be comfortable leading cross-functional machine learning product initiatives, from conception to successful product outcomes
- Experience and/or interest in mentoring junior engineers

Salary Range: $200,000 - $240,000 annually
