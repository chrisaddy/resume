## Job Filtering Decision
This position should be filtered out because:
1. **Recruiting Agency Red Flags**:
   - The actual company is not named, making proper research impossible
   - Compensation includes vaguely defined "Tokenized Assets" 
   - Job description lacks specificity about the actual role and company
   - Posting appears to be a generic talent search for crypto/AI startups rather than a specific position

2. **Computer Vision Requirements**:
   - The job explicitly requires computer vision fundamentals
   - Strong emphasis on image/video generation and avatar creation
   - These are areas identified in filtering criteria as ones to skip

3. **Crypto/Blockchain Focus**:
   - The company is described as a "decentralized platform" with crypto VC backing
   - Compensation includes "tokenized assets"
   - This suggests significant crypto/blockchain involvement, which may represent a significant pivot

4. **Overall Suspiciousness**:
   - Lack of company identification
   - Vague descriptions of responsibilities
   - Unusual compensation structure
   - Limited details about product beyond claimed user metrics

## Overall Assessment
- Current match rate: Approximately 50-60%
- Target match rate: 85%+
- Primary gaps: 
  - Computer vision experience requirements
  - Heavy focus on image/video generation
  - Crypto/blockchain component
  - Vague job description from recruiting agency
- Recommended action: Move to filtered_out folder due to the job being posted by a recruiting agency without naming the actual company, having significant computer vision requirements, and involving crypto/blockchain technologies
