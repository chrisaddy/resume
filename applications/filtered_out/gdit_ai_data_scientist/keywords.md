- **MLOps/DevOps Focus**: While the job mentions AWS DevOps as a desired certification, it is not primarily a DevOps role. The core focus is on AI, data science, and data architectures.
- **Computer Vision Experience**: No specific computer vision experience is required.
- **ML/Python Component**: The job has a strong ML component, focusing on Generative AI, LLMs, NLP, and other ML technologies.
- **Qualifications Match**: There appears to be a significant gap between requirements and current qualifications:
  - The job requires 15+ years of related experience
  - The job requires 10+ years of experience with Data Fabrics, Knowledge Graphs, or Graphs
  - The job requires AWS Certified Machine Learning - Specialty and/or Azure AI Engineer Associate certifications
  - The job requires 5+ years of experience with Data Fabrics on Microsoft Azure, AWS, or Databricks
  - The job requires 5+ years of experience in Generative AI, Machine Learning, NLP, Intelligent Search, or LLMs
