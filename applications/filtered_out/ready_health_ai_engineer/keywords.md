## Job Filtering Decision
This position should be filtered out because:
1. **Computer Vision Experience**: 
   - The job requires experience with OCR, document processing, and computer vision
   - These are specifically mentioned in the filtering criteria as areas to skip
   - The document processing and OCR requirements are central to the role

2. **Overall Qualification Match**:
   - While the years of experience requirement (7+) matches your criteria
   - The specific technical skills needed (OCR, document processing, computer vision) represent a significant gap

3. **Other Considerations**:
   - The role has many positive aspects (AI-focused, healthcare domain, early-stage startup)
   - The salary is likely competitive
   - But the computer vision requirement is a clear filtering criterion

## Resume Improvement Suggestions
If you were to apply despite the filter criteria:
- Emphasize any experience with document processing systems
- Highlight any OCR or document automation work
- Showcase LLM fine-tuning and deployment experience
- Emphasize any experience with agentic workflows and RAG architectures
- Add examples of building systems from scratch (greenfield projects)

## Cover Letter Keyword Strategy
- Key phrases to naturally incorporate: LLMs, Document Processing, Agentic Workflows, RAG
- Technical terms to include: Prompt Engineering, Vector Databases, Fine-tuning
