### Gaps
- Years of experience (7 vs. required 12+)
- Limited evidence of Computer Vision experience
- No explicit mention of specific ML frameworks like TensorFlow/PyTorch
- Limited evidence of some specific ML best practices mentioned in the job description

### Qualification Match Rate
- High-priority requirements met: ~60-70%
- Overall requirements met: ~65-75%
- **Below the 80% threshold specified in your job filtering criteria**

## Recommendation
While you have strong ML leadership experience and many relevant skills, there are two significant gaps:

1. The years of experience (7 vs. required 12+) is a substantial difference
2. The qualification match is below your 80% threshold

Options:
1. Consider this a reach position but still pursue it, highlighting your strengths in ML leadership, NLP, and fast career progression
2. Skip this application per your filtering criteria
3. Customize your resume to better emphasize any additional relevant experience not fully captured in your current resume

If you decide to proceed, the resume customization should focus on:
- Highlighting any Computer Vision experience you may have
- Emphasizing your depth of ML experience to partially offset the years gap
- Adding specific ML frameworks and technologies you've worked with
- Focusing on the pace of your career growth and leadership achievements
