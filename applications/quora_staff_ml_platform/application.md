## Job Description
### Overview
[Quora is a "remote-first" company. This position can be performed remotely from multiple countries around the world. Please visit careers.quora.com/eligible-countries for details regarding employment eligibility by country.]

### About Quora:
Quora's mission is to grow and share the world's knowledge. To do so, we have two knowledge sharing products:

Quora: a global knowledge sharing platform with over 400M monthly unique visitors, bringing people together to share insights on various topics and providing a unique platform to learn and connect with others.

Poe: a platform providing millions of global users with one place to chat, explore and build with a wide variety of AI language models (bots), including GPT-4, Claude 3, Gemini Pro, DALL-E 3 and more. As AI capabilities rapidly advance, Poe provides a single platform to instantly integrate and utilize these new models.

Behind these products are passionate, collaborative, and high-performing global teams. We have a culture rooted in transparency, idea-sharing, and experimentation that allows us to celebrate success and grow together through meaningful work. Join us on this journey to create a positive impact and make a significant change in the world.

This role will be working on our Quora product.

### About the Team and Role:
Machine Learning plays an important role in helping Quora further its mission of growing and sharing the world's knowledge. We have 100+ Machine Learning models in production powering various product features. We use a variety of algorithms â€” everything from linear models to decision trees and deep neural networks. Our production models operate at a huge scale and help over a hundred million people using Quora every month.

We want to empower all ML engineers at Quora to be as impactful as they can be in solving different ML problems at scale. To that end, we are looking for engineers to help us build our company-wide ML development platform. In this role, you will be the part of a small team solving very interesting technical problems at the intersection of exciting domains like Machine Learning, Distributed Systems and High Performance Computing. Your work will have an enormous impact on Quora's long-term success. This role will focus primarily on ML infrastructure and Distributed System (80%), with some involvement in supporting model deployment (20%).
