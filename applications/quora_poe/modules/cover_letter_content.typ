#let body_paragraph = {
  [Throughout my career, I have specialized in building and scaling machine learning systems that deliver tangible business value. At Pepsico, I founded and led the Generative AI Lab, where I tech led multiple projects implementing LLMs and transformer models with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. I also designed scalable recommender system architectures that significantly improved personalization and user engagement. My experience spans end-to-end ML ownership – from feature engineering and candidate extraction to model training and production deployment – with particular expertise in search and retrieval systems. Having built multiple ML teams from the ground up, I understand the challenges of creating reliable, production-ready AI applications while pushing the boundaries of what's technically possible.]
