  [Throughout my career, I have specialized in building high-performing ML teams and implementing recommendation systems that deliver measurable business impact. At PepsiCo, I built and led a team of 8 machine learning engineers, establishing processes that increased productivity by 200% and shortened development cycles from months to days. At URBN, I led the development of e-commerce personalization systems using recommendation algorithms that improved click-through rates by 15%. My experience spans the full ML lifecycleâ€”from hiring and mentoring talent to implementing data-driven experimentation frameworks and deploying production models at scale. I've consistently focused on fostering cross-functional collaboration between ML teams and product engineering to deliver features that directly improve user experiences.]
