IN THIS ROLE, YOU'LL:

Lead and manage a team of 7-10 data scientists, ML engineers, and software engineers, creating processes that enable autonomous operation within cross-functional teams while maintaining high quality standards and accountability for AI/ML product delivery.
Drive architectural strategy for AI/ML systems, with particular focus on implementing LLM-powered features and GenAI applications that enhance our product experience and customer engagement.
Guide the development and implementation of our next-generation chat experiences and AI-augmented analytics initiatives, ensuring successful delivery of conversational interfaces for both customer-facing and internal tools.
Direct the development of AI and ML-driven personalization systems across our product suite. Engender great developer experiences for AI and ML systems across our technology teams.
Foster strong working relationships across engineering, product, and design teams to ensure successful integration of AI and ML systems into our technology stack.
Create ambitious yet achievable quarterly roadmaps that advance our ML/AI infrastructure that enhance your team's ability to deliver tangible value to users through work with product development teams.
Be accountable for making, measuring, and delivering on team commitments, particularly in experimentation and the systematic deployment of ML/AI features.
Invest in your team by building and supporting individualized growth and development plans aligned with our company's organizational strategy, focusing on technical abilities and product shipping mindset.
Create impactful mentorship relationships that drive higher quality AI/ML system design and implementation across teams.

ABOUT YOU ü¶Ñ

You have a build first mindset and have led teams that deliver customer facing products.
You have deep expertise in machine learning and a strong understanding of modern ML systems architecture, especially in deploying LLMs and generative AI in production environments.
You have 3+ years of experience managing teams of data scientists, ML engineers, and software engineers. You've successfully led engineering teams in delivering user-facing AI/ML products and know how to cultivate a culture of technical excellence alongside strong product delivery.
You're experienced in implementing and scaling AI/ML systems, with particular focus on real-time inference, model monitoring, and maintaining high-quality production AI/ML services.
You have hands-on experience building and deploying LLM-powered features in production, including prompt engineering, context management, and responsible AI practices.
You can tailor your management style to suit your employees, identifying where some people might succeed with a more hands-off approach than others.
You excel at stakeholder management and can build effective relationships across the organization. You self-organize a peer group to gain feedback and can lead both directly and through influence.
Expert experience in experimentation is a must - you'll guide systematic approaches to ML feature testing, implementation, and assessment across the company.
