## My Elevator Pitch
"I'm an experienced ML engineering leader with a track record of building and shipping innovative AI products that drive measurable business impact. At URBN, I've led a team of ML engineers focused on generative AI applications and LLM implementations that enhanced customer experiences across their portfolio of brands. Previously at PepsiCo, I established their Generative AI Lab and scaled ML capabilities across the organization.

My expertise lies in architecting production ML systems, implementing experimentation frameworks, and fostering cross-functional collaboration to ensure successful integration of AI technologies. I'm particularly passionate about building ML systems that solve real user problems rather than pursuing academic perfection, which aligns well with Rocket Money's focus on delivering practical financial solutions.

I've worked extensively with LLMs, personalization systems, and conversational interfaces, and I'm excited about applying these technologies to help improve people's financial lives."

## Why I'm Looking for a New Role
"While I've valued my experience at URBN building ML infrastructure and leading their generative AI initiatives, I'm seeking a role that allows me to make a more direct impact on users' daily lives. Financial wellness is an area where AI can create tremendous value, and I'm excited about the opportunity to help people improve their financial situations through innovative technology.

Additionally, I'm drawn to Rocket Money's mission of financial empowerment and the chance to work with a team dedicated to solving meaningful problems in the personal finance space. The combination of a startup mindset with the resources of a larger organization creates an ideal environment for innovation."

## Why I'm Looking to Leave Current Role So Early
"I'm exploring new opportunities because I'm looking to deepen my experience with applied generative AI in domains where it can significantly impact people's daily lives. While URBN has provided valuable experience in retail AI applications, I'm particularly drawn to fintech as a space where AI can create transformative value.

At URBN, I've successfully built the foundation for their generative AI initiatives, and the team is now in a strong position with established processes and infrastructure. I see this transition as a natural progression in my career, allowing me to apply my expertise in a new domain while continuing to grow as a technical leader."

## What I'm Looking For in My Next Role
"I'm seeking a role where I can:
1. Lead a talented, cross-functional team developing AI solutions that meaningfully impact users' lives
2. Apply cutting-edge AI technologies, particularly LLMs and generative AI, to solve real-world problems
3. Balance technical excellence with pragmatic product delivery
4. Continue growing as both a technical expert and leader
5. Work in a mission-driven environment with a clear purpose

Rocket Money offers this compelling combination with its focus on financial empowerment through technology, emphasis on LLM-powered features, and the opportunity to lead a substantial team building products that directly help people."
