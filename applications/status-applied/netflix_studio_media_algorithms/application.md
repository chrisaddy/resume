We are looking for a software engineer with experience in the machine learning (ML), computer vision (CV), and/or graphics domain to design and develop scalable systems and infrastructure for that effort. These systems will be used by our researchers to develop CV, graphics, audio, and natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to analyze, create, and transform media assets.

In this role, you will:

Design and develop systems and reusable algorithms and frameworks for the full cycle of machine learning in the multimedia domain, such as data processing, feature extraction, distributed model training with GPUs, and deploying the produced models into production.

Collaborate cross-functionally with research scientists, product managers, as well as creative and business partners and stakeholders, to help define and prioritize system requirements.

Work closely with ML/CV/Graphics researchers and Studio teams to productize algorithms and models, and efficiently run human-in-the-loop inference tasks.

Participate in algorithm development and propose scalable designs.

Promote and facilitate software engineering best practices in the team.

About you:

Industry experience with machine learning engineering in a production setting

Passion for turning ideas into products and improving the user experience

Experience with research and comfort with the ambiguity of an emerging field

Skills in OO programming (Python, Java, or C++)

Experience with ML, CV, and/or graphics pipelines

Excellent communication and people engagement skills

Experience with large-scale distributed data processing systems and cloud infrastructure

Industry experience in the content creation domain, such as animation, games, or visual effects

Experience with models and tools for generative models, such as Diffusion models and ComfyUI

Bonus experience:

Building end-to-end multimedia systems and algorithms

Deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch and Tensorflow

Computer graphics and VFX tools and game engines such as Unreal Engine, Unity, Maya, or Nuke

Salary Range: $150,000 - $750,000
