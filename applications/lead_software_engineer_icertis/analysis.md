- Preferred: Experience with MLOps tools and practices
- Preferred: Containerization (Docker, Kubernetes)

### Role Type
- This is an Applied AI Engineering role focused on building ML solutions for contract analysis
- Has MLOps components but is not primarily an MLOps or DevOps role
- No mention of Computer Vision requirements

### Years of Experience
- 6+ years of experience in software development with a focus on applied AI/ML

### Python/ML Components
- Strong Python programming required
- ML model development and implementation
- NLP and text analytics for contract processing
- Working with ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn)
- Operationalizing ML models in production

## Evaluation Against Filtering Criteria

| Criterion | Meets? | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Salary above $180K | ✅ | Upper range ($190K) is above the $180K threshold |
| Not MLOps/DevOps focused | ✅ | Primary focus is AI engineering, not MLOps or DevOps |
| No extensive CV experience | ✅ | No computer vision requirements mentioned |
| Has ML/Python component | ✅ | Strong ML/Python focus throughout the role |
| Matches qualification (7+ years) | ⚠️ | Requires 6+ years which is close but slightly below the 7+ years criterion |

## Additional Considerations
- The role focuses on NLP and contract analysis, which aligns well with ML engineering
- Working with transformer models (BERT, GPT) is a great fit for modern ML engineering
- The role involves mentoring junior engineers, indicating a senior-level position
- The requirement is 6+ years, which is just shy of the 7+ years filtering criterion

## Recommendation
**Proceed with application**

While the job requires 6+ years of experience (slightly below the 7+ years criterion), all other criteria are met, including salary range and strong ML/Python focus. The role is primarily focused on applied AI engineering rather than MLOps or DevOps, and has no computer vision requirements. The nature of the work (NLP, transformer models, contract analysis) aligns well with ML engineering expertise.
