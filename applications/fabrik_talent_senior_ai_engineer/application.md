## Job Description
We're recruiting for a leading AGI company building the next generation of foundational AI models.

As their Senior AI Engineer, you'll work on LLM inference at scale, focusing on ultra-low latency, maximal throughput, and GPU efficiency. You'll deep dive into the engineering that powers real-time AI, optimizing every cycle and byte to push performance boundaries.

If you're passionate about high-performance systems, large model deployment, and crafting beautifully efficient code, we'd love to talk.

What you'll do:
- Architect and optimize inference pipelines for large language models (LLMs).
- Tune and redesign systems for the lowest latency and highest throughput on GPUs.
- Write high-performance C++ code, leveraging CUDA, TensorRT/PyTorch, and similar libraries.
- Collaborate with research and infrastructure teams to productionize cutting-edge models.
- Benchmark, profile, and improve system bottlenecks at every layer.
- Stay close to the hardware â€” understanding and exploiting the latest GPU architectures.

What we're looking for:
- Strong C++ engineering skills, including experience writing high-performance, low-latency systems.
- Deep understanding of GPU programming, optimization techniques, and distributed inference.
- Hands-on experience with LLM inference, tensor libraries, or ML compilers (e.g., TensorRT, TVM, Triton).
- Passion for performance engineering, systems architecture, and squeezing every drop from hardware.
- (Bonus) Experience with serving infrastructure, quantization, or model parallelism.
- Someone based on the East Coast (or willing to relocate)

Salary Range: $200K/yr - $300K/yr
