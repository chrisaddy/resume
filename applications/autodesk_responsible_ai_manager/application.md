## Personal Connection
- Have you used their product/service? Yes
- If yes, describe your experience: I've used AutoCAD and Fusion 360 for personal design projects. During my time at Temple University, I also worked with Autodesk's 3ds Max for visualization projects. More recently, I've been exploring Autodesk's generative design capabilities to understand how AI is transforming the design process.
- How long have you used it? Approximately 5 years intermittently
- What impact has it had on you? Autodesk's tools have significantly expanded my ability to conceptualize and prototype ideas, allowing me to bridge the gap between concept and implementation. They've given me an appreciation for how powerful design tools can democratize innovation when made accessible.
- Any specific features or aspects you particularly value? I particularly value Autodesk's focus on integrating AI into design workflows in responsible ways. The generative design capabilities that optimize for specific constraints while providing designers with multiple viable solutions represent exactly the kind of human-AI collaboration that I believe should be central to responsible AI development.
- How does this connection relate to your professional interest in the company? My experience with Autodesk products has given me firsthand appreciation for the impact of well-designed, responsible AI tools on creative processes. This aligns with my professional interest in developing AI systems that empower users rather than replace them, and that provide transparency and control over the AI-assisted design process. I'm excited about contributing to the research that ensures these powerful tools continue to develop in safe, reliable, and ethically sound ways.
