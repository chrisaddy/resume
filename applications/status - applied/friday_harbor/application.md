## Job Description
Every year, over 8 million people take out a residential mortgage, enabling them to achieve the dream of homeownership. Yet, the traditional mortgage process remains slow, manual, and opaqueâ€”leading to delays, inefficiencies, and potential unfair treatment.

At Friday Harbor, we're revolutionizing mortgage origination by replacing outdated, paper-based workflows with secure, AI-powered digital systems that ensure fairness and build trust. Born from pioneering research at the AI2 Incubator in Seattle, our advanced technology aims to:
- Transform Outdated Systems into Digital Workflows: Replace cumbersome manual processes with automated, efficient systems.
- Ensure Fair and Unbiased Lending: Leverage AI to eliminate human bias, evaluating each applicant on data-driven criteria.
- Enhance Transparency and Trust: Deliver transparent platforms that empower borrowers and lenders with clear, reliable insights.

Responsibilities:
- Evals: Create a data labeling framework to support the measurement of AI experiences for improving software.
- Build Core AI Infrastructure: Develop and deploy robust AI platforms and services.
- Contextual Retrieval Systems: Design and implement retrieval systems leveraging RAG, Elasticsearch, and other contextual search tools.
- AI Observability: Create comprehensive observability tooling for ML/AI models.
- Agentic AI Systems: Architect sophisticated agent-based AI systems for workflows and decision-making.
- Feature Engineering: Develop scalable feature pipelines and leverage modern platforms (e.g., Feast, Tecton, Hopsworks).
- Fairness and Safety: Integrate fairness, interpretability, and safety considerations into AI infrastructure.
- Innovate and Collaborate: Work closely with the CTO and cross-functional teams.

Requirements:
- 3+ years of experience building and maintaining scalable ML/AI platforms or products.
- 7+ years of experience in software engineering roles.
- Deep proficiency in Python and familiarity with ML/AI frameworks and libraries.
- Proven track record deploying and maintaining robust, production-grade ML/AI infrastructure.
- Strong knowledge of cloud platforms (preferably AWS), Kubernetes, Docker, and container orchestration.
- Hands-on experience implementing observability and monitoring systems for ML/AI models.
- Experience building advanced retrieval systems using tools such as Elasticsearch, RAG, or equivalent technologies.
- Solid understanding of data pipelines, feature engineering, and feature store solutions.
- Bachelor's or Master's degree in Computer Science, AI, Data Science, or related fields.
