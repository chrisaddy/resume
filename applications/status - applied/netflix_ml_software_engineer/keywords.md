## Resume Improvement Suggestions
- Modify URBN bullet about MLflow to emphasize "algorithm development" and "prototyping"
- Rephrase Penn Interactive recommender system bullet to highlight "media asset processing" and "full stack engineering"
- Add explicit mention of "frontend" experience in Penn Interactive or URBN work
- Update Pepsico Generative AI Lab bullet to emphasize "algorithm integration" across systems
- Add specific mention of "localization" or "globalization" experience, connecting it to existing NLP work
- Include "PyTorch" in technical skills or specific projects where applicable
- Rephrase lead ML engineering bullet to emphasize comfort with "ambiguity" and "minimal oversight"
- Add "algorithmic" as a descriptor to several existing technical achievements

## Cover Letter Keyword Strategy
- Key phrases to naturally incorporate: 
  - "algorithm development and integration"
  - "full stack engineering expertise" 
  - "globalization/localization challenges"
  - "comfort with ambiguity"
  - "algorithmic prototypes with scalable impact"
  - "cross-functional innovation"
- Technical terms to include: 
  - "PyTorch" 
  - "media asset processing"
  - "distributed systems"
  - "algorithm tooling"
  - "frontend and backend systems"
- Industry-specific terminology: 
  - "content localization"
  - "global member experiences"
  - "algorithm-based solutions"
  - "integration paths"
- Leadership/soft skill terms: 
  - "freedom and responsibility" (Netflix culture)
  - "cross-functional collaboration"
  - "self-directed innovation"
  - "technical evangelism"

## Overall Assessment
- Current match rate: 55-60%
- Target match rate: 85%+
- Primary gaps: 
  - Limited explicit "algorithm" terminology
  - Missing frontend engineering emphasis
  - No mention of localization/globalization experience
  - Lack of PyTorch or specific ML framework mentions
  - No explicit statement about comfort with ambiguity
- Recommended adjustments:
  - Reframe ML work as "algorithmic development"
  - Connect recommender system work to media asset processing
  - Highlight full stack aspects of engineering experience
  - Draw parallels between NLP work and localization challenges
  - Emphasize self-directed nature of past work to align with Netflix culture
