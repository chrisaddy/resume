  [My experience building and leading ML teams aligns perfectly with this role's requirements. At Pepsico, I led a team of 15+ ML engineers and data scientists, developing the technical vision and roadmap for recommendation and retrieval systems that directly impacted business metrics. I founded and built the Generative AI Lab, where we pioneered work with embeddings, vector search, and retrieval-augmented generation techniques. Previously, at Penn Interactive, I architected retrieval-based recommendation systems using embedding techniques that efficiently identified relevant content from large candidate pools—a challenge similar to what the Ads Retrieval team faces. Throughout these roles, I've gained deep expertise in the full ML lifecycle from feature engineering and model development to production deployment and performance monitoring at scale.]
