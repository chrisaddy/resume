# Question: Do you have experience leading Ad-Tech focused Machine Learning teams?

## Answer:

While I haven't led teams specifically labeled as 'Ad-Tech,' my experience at Penn Interactive involved leading ML initiatives for sports betting that shared many similarities with ad-tech applications. I founded the ML engineering function there, built recommendation systems for personalized experiences, implemented Bayesian A/B testing frameworks for marketing optimization, and developed real-time dashboards for user behavior insights - all core components of ad-tech systems. At Pepsico, I led teams working on direct-to-consumer recommendation models that drove revenue growth through targeted marketing, which leveraged similar ML techniques used in advertising technology.
